      "question": "The app update is trying to start me over! How can I get back to my reading for today?",
      "answer": "This is a known issue affecting some users and we are sorry! You can manually mark days as read, but if your start date is a long while ago, that will take a few minutes. We will be issuing a remedy within a few days that lets you achieve this with the tap of a button. Until then, you can reference a digital free CSV version of the Old & New schedule [here](https://martynchamberlin.github.io/yearly/yearly-bible-schedule.csv). Thank you for your patience as we work through the bumpy road of migration. 🙏"
